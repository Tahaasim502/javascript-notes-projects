# 🚀 JavaScript Notes & Projects

Welcome to my **JavaScript Notes & Projects** repository!  
This is where I document my journey learning JavaScript — from core basics to intermediate concepts — with concise notes and hands-on projects.

---

## 📚 What’s Inside?

- 📝 **Notes:**  
  Organized, bite-sized explanations of JavaScript fundamentals and beyond.

- 💻 **Projects:**  
  Practical coding projects to solidify concepts and build real skills.

- 🎯 **Goals:**  
  Build a strong JavaScript foundation to become a confident developer.

---

## 🔥 Current Focus

### Basics
- Variables (`let`, `const`)  
- Arrays and their methods (`push`, `pop`, `length`)  
- Loops (`for`, `for...of`)  

### Coming Soon: Intermediate Topics
- Functions & Scope  
- Objects & Prototypes  
- Asynchronous JS (Promises, async/await)  
- Error Handling  

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Use `const` by default, switch to `let` if reassignment is needed.  
- Remember `.push()` returns the new array length, **not** the pushed element.  
- JavaScript arrays are flexible and can store mixed data types — but watch out for type-related bugs!
